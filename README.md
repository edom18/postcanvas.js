This app is demo script.
Mobiel safari has a problem that can't send any files to server. (Of course, any image files too)

It give to send a image on canvas.
User can draw to the canvas any lines and send it to server.

Server is node.js.
I think that I can use it to some plan on web campaign something like that.
